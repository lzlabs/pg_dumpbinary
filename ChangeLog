2019-12-08 - version 2.0

This release fixes some issues reported by users since last release
and adds news features and improvements.

  - Add -a | --data-only option to pg_restorebinary to restore data
    only, not schema.
    Fix partition data import that do not need to delay partitions
    attachment at post data section.
  - Prevent waiting 30 seconds that the snapshot connection be closed
    at end of the dump.
  - Add support to dump/restore partitions independently from the
    partitioned tables. In previous version dumping a partitioned
    table generate the following error:
    
        ERROR: cannot copy from partitioned table "..."
    
    pg_dumpbinary dumps partitions data independently and just skip
    the partitioned table. pg_restorebinary restore partitions without
    attaching them to the partitioned table then restore data directly
    into the partition then attach the partitions to the partitioned
    table.
  - On some dumps through a firewall the inactive connection that
    maintain the snapshot state is kill after a certain time. This
    fix forks the process to keep this connection active by issuing
    a 'SELECT 1;' each 30 seconds.
  - Add date to log information when dumping pre and post section.
  - Fix restoration of table with name that need to be double quoted.
  - Fall back to UTC timezone if cannot determine the local one.
    Thanks to Luca Ferrari for the patch.
  - Changed a print to printf to allow newline. Thanks to Luca Ferrari
    for the patch.
  - Change the usage of external `date` to DateTime. Thanks to Luca 
    Ferrari for the patch.
  - Copyright and Github project moved to LzLabs, license unchanged.
